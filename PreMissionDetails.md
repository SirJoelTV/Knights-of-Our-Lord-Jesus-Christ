- As a fellow follower of Christ and someone who considers himself a spiritual knight, it is one of my long-term goals to use technology to benefit and help fellow believers and Christ's Church just like our millennial saint, St. Carlo Acutis.

- The main purpose of this Project (or campaign) is to help believers, non-believers, as well as those who have lapsed in their faith, get back to Christ and His bride, the Church.

- The world is seeing a trend of Youth coming back to Christ especially in western countries. Hence, this project may be (though not mandatory) aimed at helping the youth solidify their belief in Christ.

- I personally believe that the reasons many leave the Church are poor catechism, lack of actual faith, lack of knowledge in Church history, lack of knowledge in Sacred Scripture, as well as Sacred Tradition. I know this because I was one of them, though I never officially left the church or denied the faith. I was just another lukewarm catholic.

- I believe this Project should include ideas from the areas mentioned above.
- I do not yet know what the Project should include nor where it should start.

- Henceforth, I humbly request aid from fellow Techie Christians (even non-Catholics) to be part of this divine mission, entrusted to the Apostles and our forefathers, to spread the good news and educate our future generation on what it is to be a Christian, and make themselves thoroughly equipped to defend what was handed to us throughout the entire history of the Church, and to make them well equipped to wage spiritual warfare against this wicked world.

- Those who are genuinely interested in contributing to this work may kindly contact me through my official platforms.
- In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti, Amen.
